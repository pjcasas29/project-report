%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
  We have implemented a dockerized, automatically load-balancing IoT system and
  associated web-infrastructure for a networked smart-lighting system. Our
  system can be applied to public spaces with shared resources, potentially
  containing individual actors with competing goals - all while working to
  balance a global setpoint that best satisfies the goals of all independent
  actors in the system.

  Created with horizontal scalability in mind, our software architecture is
  well-suited towards rapid expansion of both users and resources. Our embedded
  IoT devices are connected to our GraphQL API through a Kafka pub-sub system,
  ensuring easy scalability. Our various interaction methods (voice, web app,
  EEG Reader) connect through our Pub-Sub architecture where appropriate, which
  connects them to our orchestrated containerized server architecture. Our PID
  based load-balancer ensures that there are enough server resources available
  and that the requests coming from each available endpoint are satisfied as
  much as possible in the face of possibly competing goals.

\section{Introduction}
Public spaces with adaptive smart technologies present interesting problems
regarding the satisfiability of concurrent requests for shared resources. We
explore this problem in the context of a smart lighting system in a space such
as a university library or public co-working space. Prior to the introduction of
smart technologies, users might be limited to working in a globally lit
environment, or a locally lit environment that did not effectively consider the
preferences of those around them, or of the energy usage policy of the building
or organization.

Our system enables authenticated and authorized users to make luminance-level
requests about the local lighting level. Our system balances this request with
the requests of spatially co-located individuals who have made prior requests.
These requests can either be trivially compatible with each other (e.g
co-located users making similar requests) or be incompatible (brightness
preferences outside of 10-15\%).

As IoT technology has only recently emerged as a powerful force in the
technology space, there are many situations that are in a suboptimal state. We
attempt to address one such situation through the application architecture
presented here.
